# CO2-emissions-Exporatory-data-analysis

Summary
To take note of:
Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis is an instrument tool when exploring a new dataset

Questions
What are independent variables, and how do they affect training machine learning algorithms? How does one handle them?

Multicollinearity, and its effects on data quality and how to resolve its effects

Moving averages/rolling mean?? how do they work, to what purpose do they serve in data analysis

What is meant by time series data

Reflections
- A better environment to run and practice Data Analysis (collab or Jupiter notebook well-setup will streamline the workflow
-  Storing large datasets will easily become a pain in a... solution required soon

Comments
- Subject Knowledge in statical math is highly lacking for me to understand the gameplay well enough, later on, play.
- More practice runs as this one are required for skill level up
- Try to understand your tools more i.e. libraries, languages, math
- Better understanding and implementation of Data visualizations required

Great work tho
